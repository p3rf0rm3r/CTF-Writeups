Challenge Description

The Winterbucks Cafe has a secret recipe they're trying to keep hidden. Can you find the flag?
URL: https://angietechcafe.github.io/Wintery-/wintery%20index%201.html


Analysis

The challenge provides only a web page without any user interaction. There is no form or functionality to exploit,
which suggests that the secret is stored on the client side inside the HTML source code.


Solution

Step 1: Inspecting the Page

I opened the website and used right-click → Inspect or pressed F12 to open the developer tools and view the
HTML source.

Step 2: Direct Observation of the Flag

While reading the HTML code in the Elements tab, I noticed the following string: 3ncrypt3dh0tc0c0a. It was clearly
visible and not hidden.

Step 3: Flag Format

The required flag format is atcctf_. By adding this prefix, the final flag was obtained.


Flag : atcctf_3ncrypt3dh0tc0c0a


Conclusion

This challenge highlights a common web security mistake: storing sensitive information directly in client-side code.
Any data in HTML or JavaScript can be viewed using browser developer tools.
